## 2025-08-18: Claude-Exclusive Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Build Obsidian Copilot as a Claude-exclusive system, optimizing entirely for Claude's 200K context window rather than supporting multiple LLM providers.

### Context

The original Obsidian Copilot was designed as a generic RAG system with OpenAI integration. Market analysis shows that Claude's massive context window creates unique opportunities for knowledge synthesis that smaller context models cannot match. Traditional RAG systems are limited by 4K-8K token constraints.

### Rationale

**Technical Advantages:**
- 200K context enables true vault-wide analysis vs. fragmented chunks
- Eliminates complex retrieval ranking since we can include much more context
- Reduces engineering complexity by optimizing for single provider
- Enables unique features impossible with smaller context windows

**Market Positioning:**
- Creates clear differentiation from existing Obsidian AI plugins
- Targets power users who already understand Claude's capabilities
- Aligns with growing trend toward larger context models

**Development Focus:**
- Allows optimization of context packing strategies specifically for Claude
- Enables specialized prompt engineering for Claude's response patterns
- Reduces testing surface area and maintenance overhead

## 2025-08-18: Local-First Privacy Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Security & Privacy
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Security Lead, Target Users

### Decision

Implement 100% local processing for document indexing and retrieval, with only final context sent to Claude API.

### Context

Target users (researchers, consultants, knowledge workers) handle sensitive information including proprietary research, client data, and personal notes. Cloud-based processing creates privacy and compliance risks.

### Rationale

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Complete user control over sensitive document processing
- No third-party access to vault contents during indexing
- Compliance with strict data handling requirements
- Builds trust with security-conscious user base

**Technical Implementation:**
- All embeddings generated locally using E5-small-v2
- OpenSearch runs in local Docker container
- Only final synthesized context sent to external API
- Optional encryption for local storage

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Most AI-powered knowledge tools require cloud processing
- Creates strong moat for enterprise and academic users
- Enables offline operation for core functionality

## 2025-08-18: Hybrid Retrieval Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, ML Engineer

### Decision

Implement hybrid retrieval combining OpenSearch (BM25) keyword search with semantic similarity using local embeddings, enhanced with Obsidian graph relationships.

### Context

Pure semantic search misses exact keyword matches important for research. Pure keyword search misses conceptual relationships. Obsidian's link structure provides additional relationship signals unavailable to traditional RAG systems.

### Rationale

**Retrieval Quality:**
- BM25 ensures exact term matching for specific concepts
- Semantic search captures related concepts and paraphrases  
- Graph relationships provide Obsidian-specific context signals
- Combines multiple relevance signals for better document selection

**Claude Context Optimization:**
- Multi-signal ranking helps select most relevant documents for limited context
- Graph relationships help identify document clusters for comprehensive coverage
- Enables intelligent context packing strategies

**Obsidian Native Integration:**
- Leverages existing user link structures and tagging
- Maintains compatibility with user's existing organization systems
- Provides familiar relevance signals users already understand
