## Synthesis Guidelines

### Information Integration
1. **Identify Core Concepts**: Extract the fundamental ideas from each source
2. **Map Relationships**: Show how concepts from different sources relate
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: Address contradictions between sources thoughtfully
4. **Find Patterns**: Look for recurring themes and meta-patterns
5. **Generate New Insights**: Go beyond summarizing to create new understanding

### Quality Criteria
- **Accuracy**: Faithfully represent source materials
- **Completeness**: Address all major aspects of the topic
- **Coherence**: Create logical flow and structure
- **Insight**: Provide new understanding beyond individual sources
- **Utility**: Create actionable and valuable knowledge

### Source Attribution
- Use clear citations: `([Source Title](link))` 
- Distinguish between direct quotes and paraphrasing
- Acknowledge uncertainty when synthesizing conflicting information
- Credit original insights to their authors

## Synthesis Process

### Phase 1: Analysis (Individual Sources)
- Read each source thoroughly
- Extract key concepts, arguments, and evidence
- Note methodology, perspective, and limitations
- Identify unique contributions of each source

### Phase 2: Comparison (Cross-Source)
- Compare similar concepts across sources
- Identify areas of agreement and disagreement  
- Note complementary information and perspectives
- Find gaps not addressed by any source

### Phase 3: Integration (Synthesis Creation)
- Organize information around central themes
- Create coherent narrative that incorporates all sources
- Generate new insights from the integration
- Address limitations and uncertainties

### Phase 4: Validation (Quality Check)
- Verify accurate representation of source materials
- Check logical consistency of integrated arguments
- Ensure practical value and actionability
- Confirm clear attribution and citations

## Common Synthesis Patterns

### The Convergence Pattern
When multiple sources reach similar conclusions through different paths:
- Highlight the convergent insight
- Show how different approaches validate the conclusion
- Identify what makes this insight robust

### The Complementarity Pattern  
When sources address different aspects of the same topic:
- Show how sources fit together like puzzle pieces
- Create comprehensive framework incorporating all aspects
- Identify what the complete picture reveals

### The Evolution Pattern
When sources show progression of understanding over time:
- Trace the development trajectory
- Identify key breakthrough moments
- Show current state and future directions

### The Dialogue Pattern
When sources present different viewpoints in productive tension:
- Present each perspective fairly
- Explore the productive aspects of the disagreement
- Seek higher-level synthesis that honors both views

## Advanced Techniques

### Meta-Synthesis
When synthesizing across different types of sources (research papers, practical guides, personal experiences):
- Acknowledge different types of evidence and their strengths
- Weight contributions appropriately
- Create framework that accommodates different knowledge types

### Temporal Synthesis
When dealing with evolving topics:
- Distinguish between historical understanding and current knowledge
- Show trajectory of development
- Identify persistent vs. transient insights

### Multi-Perspective Synthesis
When sources represent different disciplines or viewpoints:
- Respect disciplinary differences
- Find common ground and complementary insights
- Create interdisciplinary understanding

Remember: Great synthesis creates value greater than the sum of its sources. Aim to help users see connections and insights they couldn't see from individual sources alone.
