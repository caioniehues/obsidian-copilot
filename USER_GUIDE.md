## Getting Started

### Your First Query

The simplest way to use Obsidian Copilot is the double-hash trigger:

```markdown
## How do neural networks learn?
```

Simply type this in any note, wait 5-10 seconds, and watch as Claude analyzes your vault and generates a comprehensive response.

### How It Works

1. **You type** a question after `##`
2. **RAG retrieves** relevant notes from your vault
3. **Context builds** using your chosen strategy
4. **Claude analyzes** with up to 200K tokens
5. **Response appears** below your question

## Basic Usage

### Simple Questions

Ask anything, and Copilot searches your vault for context:

```markdown
## What are my thoughts on productivity?
## Summarize my meeting notes from last week
## What connections exist between my psychology and philosophy notes?
```

### Direct Commands

Control behavior with inline commands:

```markdown
## strategy=full_docs
Comprehensive analysis of my research on consciousness

## tokens=180000
Use maximum context to analyze my entire PKM system

## focus=recent
What have I been learning about lately?
```

## Working with Agents

### The 5 Agents at Your Service

#### 1. üîç Vault Analyzer (Autonomous)

Runs daily at 2 AM, analyzing your entire vault.

**Check the daily report:**
```markdown
[[Agent Reports/Daily Analysis/2024-01-15]]
```

**Run manually:**
```markdown
## agent:analyze-vault
```

**Focused analysis:**
```markdown
## agent:analyze topic="machine learning"
Analyze my machine learning notes specifically
```

#### 2. üìù Synthesis Assistant (On-Demand)

Creates comprehensive syntheses from multiple documents.

**Basic synthesis:**
```markdown
## agent:synthesize
Create a synthesis of my notes on habits
```

**Thematic synthesis:**
```markdown
## agent:synthesize type=thematic
Group my psychology notes by theme
```

**Chronological synthesis:**
```markdown
## agent:synthesize type=chronological
Timeline of my project development notes
```

**Comparative synthesis:**
```markdown
## agent:synthesize type=comparative docs=["Note1", "Note2", "Note3"]
Compare different productivity systems I've studied
```

#### 3. ‚ö° Context Optimizer (Background)

Works continuously to improve performance. No commands needed - it just makes everything faster!

**Check optimization status:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/agents/context-optimizer/status
```

#### 4. üí° Suggestion Engine (Proactive)

Watches as you work and provides suggestions.

**Enable/disable suggestions:**
```markdown
## suggestions:on
## suggestions:off
```

**Get suggestions for current note:**
```markdown
## agent:suggest
What should I explore related to this note?
```

#### 5. üî¨ Research Assistant (Interactive)

Conducts deep research across your vault.

**Basic research:**
```markdown
## agent:research
Research the evolution of my thoughts on AI
```

**Comprehensive research:**
```markdown
## agent:research depth=comprehensive
Exhaustive analysis of my knowledge management system
```

**Literature review:**
```markdown
## agent:research type=literature_review
Review all my notes on cognitive science
```

**Hypothesis testing:**
```markdown
## agent:research type=hypothesis
Test: "My productivity increases with time-blocking"
```

## Context Strategies

### Choosing the Right Strategy

| Strategy | Best For | Token Usage | Speed |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `full_docs` | Deep understanding, comprehensive analysis | 150K-200K | Slower (10-15s) |
| `smart_chunks` | Balanced performance, most queries | 50K-100K | Moderate (5-10s) |
| `hierarchical` | Large vaults, quick responses | 30K-50K | Fast (2-5s) |

### Strategy Examples

**Full Documents** - When you need complete context:
```markdown
## strategy=full_docs
Analyze the complete argument structure in my philosophy notes
```

**Smart Chunks** - For balanced performance:
```markdown
## strategy=smart_chunks
What are the main themes in my research notes?
```

**Hierarchical** - For quick overviews:
```markdown
## strategy=hierarchical
Give me a high-level summary of my PKM system
```

## Daily Workflows

### Morning Routine

```

### Pattern Detection

Find patterns across time:

```markdown
## agent:patterns timeframe="30d"
What patterns emerged in the last month?
```

### Knowledge Graph Exploration

Explore connections:

```markdown
## agent:graph center="Machine Learning"
Map connections from machine learning to other topics
```

### Custom Agent Behavior

Modify agent focus:

```markdown
## agent:config vault-analyzer focus=["AI", "productivity", "philosophy"]

```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple queries:

```markdown
## batch
1. Summarize my daily notes from last week
2. Find connections between projects
3. Identify recurring themes
## end-batch
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Better Results

1. **Be specific** with queries
   - ‚ùå "Tell me about productivity"
   - ‚úÖ "How has my understanding of productivity evolved over the last 6 months?"

2. **Use context clues**
   - ‚ùå "Summarize the meeting"
   - ‚úÖ "Summarize my meeting notes tagged #client-meeting from this week"

3. **Leverage your tags and links**
   - The system understands Obsidian's `[[links]]` and `#tags`
   - Reference them in queries for better targeting

### For Faster Responses

1. **Use hierarchical strategy** for overviews
2. **Limit scope** with timeframes or tags
3. **Cache common queries** with `## cache:save name="query-name"`
4. **Disable unused agents** to free resources

### For Deeper Analysis

1. **Use full_docs strategy** for complete context
2. **Chain queries** to build understanding
3. **Combine agents** for comprehensive research
4. **Review agent memories** to understand their learning

## Understanding Agent Responses

### Response Format

```markdown
## Your Query

### ü§ñ Response from [Agent Name]
[Generated content]

**Context used**: 45,231 tokens
**Documents analyzed**: 23
**Generation time**: 7.3s
**Confidence**: High
```

### Confidence Indicators
- **High**: Strong evidence from multiple sources
- **Medium**: Moderate evidence or single source
- **Low**: Limited evidence or inference

### Following Up

After any response, you can:
- `## explain` - Get more detail
- `## continue` - Continue the thought
- `## refine with [new context]` - Refine with additional info
- `## synthesize this` - Create synthesis from response

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "No relevant documents found"
- Check your vault path ends with `/`
- Rebuild indices: `make build-artifacts`
- Try broader search terms

### "Response cut off"
- Increase token limit: `## tokens=180000`
- Use `## continue` to get rest

### "Slow responses"
- Switch to `hierarchical` strategy
- Reduce token limit
- Check if Context Optimizer is running

### "Agents not responding"
- Check status: `curl http://localhost:8000/agents/list`
- Restart scheduler: `make restart-scheduler`
- Check logs: `.agent-os/logs/`

## Learning from Agent Memories

### View What Agents Learned

Search your vault for agent memories:

```markdown
tag:#agent:vault-analyzer
tag:#type:pattern
tag:#type:insight
tag:#type:preference
```

### Understanding Memory Structure

```markdown
# Pattern Memory
**Agent**: vault-analyzer
**Type**: pattern

## Observations
- [pattern] You frequently research AI ethics
- [frequency] 15 times in last month
- [confidence] 0.92

## Relations
- relates_to [[AI Research]]
- influences [[Writing Topics]]
```

### Using Memories

Agent memories improve their performance:
- Patterns help predict your needs
- Preferences customize responses
- Insights guide suggestions
- Feedback improves accuracy

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start Simple**: Use basic `##` queries first
2. **Learn Agents**: Try each agent individually
3. **Find Your Flow**: Develop personal workflows
4. **Review Learning**: Check agent memories weekly
5. **Provide Feedback**: Help agents learn your preferences
6. **Experiment**: Try different strategies and commands
7. **Chain Operations**: Combine agents for power workflows
