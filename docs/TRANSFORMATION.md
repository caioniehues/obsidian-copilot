- **Reduce Complexity:** Eliminate vector databases and semantic search infrastructure
- **Improve Relevancy:** Claude's natural language understanding often superior to embedding-based retrieval

**Trade-off:** Less sophisticated retrieval ranking but better overall relevance and understanding

#### 4. Vault Integration Approach
**Decision:** Permission-based optional vault access vs. automatic integration
**Rationale:**
- **Privacy First:** Users explicitly choose what Claude can access
- **Security:** Granular control over file and folder permissions
- **Performance:** Only include relevant context instead of full vault indexing

**Trade-off:** Requires user configuration vs. automatic context inclusion

### Architecture Pattern Changes

#### From: Microservices Architecture
```typescript
// Complex service coordination
class BackendService {
  async query(text: string) {
    const health = await this.checkHealth();
    const context = await this.retrievalService.search(text);
    const response = await this.llmService.chat(text, context);
    return this.formatResponse(response);
  }
}
```

#### To: Direct Process Integration
```typescript  
// Simple CLI subprocess management
class ClaudeCLIService {
  async chat(message: string, options: CLIOptions) {
    const process = spawn('claude', ['chat'], { 
      input: this.formatMessage(message, options) 
    });
    return this.parseStreamingResponse(process.stdout);
  }
}
```
