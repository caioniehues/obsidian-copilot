# ü§ñ Agent OS Overview

> Understanding the autonomous agent system that powers Obsidian Copilot

## What is Agent OS?

Agent OS is an intelligent system of 5 specialized agents that work autonomously and collaboratively to enhance your knowledge management. Unlike traditional tools that only respond to queries, these agents:

- **Learn** from your interactions and improve over time
- **Work autonomously** even when you're not using Obsidian
- **Share knowledge** with each other through Basic Memory
- **Proactively suggest** improvements and connections
- **Remember** patterns, preferences, and insights

## The Five Agents

### 1. üîç Vault Analyzer
**Role**: Your knowledge archaeologist  
**Type**: Autonomous  
**Schedule**: Runs daily at 2 AM  

Continuously excavates insights from your vault, identifying patterns, connections, and opportunities you might miss.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies recurring themes and concepts across your vault
- **Connection Discovery**: Finds non-obvious relationships between disparate notes
- **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Identifies areas where information is missing or incomplete
- **Trend Identification**: Detects emerging topics and evolving themes over time
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates the completeness and interconnectedness of notes

**Daily Analysis Protocol:**
1. **Data Collection** (0-10 min): Gather changed notes and metadata
2. **Pattern Analysis** (10-20 min): Extract themes, analyze links and tags
3. **Deep Analysis** (20-30 min): Semantic clustering, knowledge graph analysis
4. **Insight Generation** (30-40 min): Generate connections and gap identification
5. **Report Generation** (40-45 min): Create comprehensive markdown report

**Output Example:**
```markdown

### Inter-Agent Communication

Agents share information through Basic Memory using this coordination flow:

```
Vault Analyzer ‚Üí discovers patterns ‚Üí Suggestion Engine
                                    ‚Üì
                            suggests synthesis
                                    ‚Üì
Synthesis Assistant ‚Üê retrieves context ‚Üê Context Optimizer
                    ‚Üì
            creates synthesis
                    ‚Üì
Research Assistant ‚Üê learns from synthesis patterns
```

### Priority System

When multiple agents need resources:
1. **Context Optimizer** (highest priority - maintains performance)
2. **Vault Analyzer** (scheduled, important insights)
3. **Suggestion Engine** (user-facing, real-time)
4. **Synthesis Assistant** (on-demand, can wait)
5. **Research Assistant** (resource-intensive, lowest priority)

### Collaboration Examples

2. Shares pattern with Suggestion Engine
3. Suggestion Engine proactively offers related content on Wednesdays

**Research ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Analysis**
1. Research Assistant investigates a topic
2. Synthesis Assistant combines findings
3. Vault Analyzer identifies new patterns from synthesis

**Optimization ‚Üí Performance**

2. Adjusts caching strategy
3. All agents benefit from faster retrieval

## Agent Memory System

### How Agents Learn

Agents store memories in your vault through Basic Memory:

```
agent-os/memory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/        # Recurring behaviors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preferences/     # User preferences  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ executions/      # Task history
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ insights/        # Generated insights
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feedback/        # User responses
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ optimizations/   # Performance improvements
```

### Memory Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Pattern** | Recognize recurring behaviors | "User researches AI ethics every Wednesday" |
| **Preference** | Customize responses | "User prefers bullet-point summaries" |
| **Execution** | Track performance | "Synthesis of 5 docs took 3.2 seconds" |
| **Insight** | Store discoveries | "Strong connection between notes A and B" |
| **Feedback** | Learn from responses | "User liked chronological format" |

### Memory Format

Each memory is stored as semantic markdown:

```markdown
# Pattern Memory
**Agent**: vault-analyzer
**Created**: 2024-01-15T10:30:00
**Type**: pattern

## Observations
- [pattern] Weekly review notes every Sunday
- [frequency] 12 occurrences
- [confidence] 0.92 confidence level

## Relations
- relates_to [[Work Habits]]

## Agent Intelligence

### Context Awareness

Agents understand:
- **Temporal context**: What you're working on now vs. historically
- **Semantic context**: Meaning and relationships between concepts
- **Task context**: Your goals and workflows
- **Personal context**: Your preferences and patterns

### Decision Making

Agents make decisions based on:
1. **Relevance scoring**: Mathematical relevance to current context
2. **Historical patterns**: What worked before
3. **User preferences**: Learned preferences
4. **Performance metrics**: What's most efficient
5. **Collaborative input**: Information from other agents

### Learning Mechanisms

**Reinforcement Learning**
- Positive feedback strengthens behaviors
- Negative feedback reduces behaviors
- Neutral interactions maintain status quo

**Pattern Recognition**
- Frequency analysis of behaviors
- Temporal pattern detection
- Semantic clustering of concepts

**Preference Modeling**
- Implicit learning from usage
- Explicit learning from feedback
- Continuous refinement
